The provided diff shows the creation of a new directory layout for the `mahdi_coin_app` project. Here is a review of the changes:

### New Directory Structure:

1. **Backend (`backend/`)**:
    - **App (`app/`)**:
        - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the app package.
        - `routes.py`: Contains the routing definitions.
        - `health.py`: Presumably contains health check endpoints.
    - **Config (`config/`)**:
        - `config.py`: Configuration settings for the app.
    - **Logs (`logs/`)**: Directory for log files.
    - `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the backend Docker image.
    - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the backend.
    - `wsgi.py`: Entry point for WSGI servers.

2. **Frontend (`frontend/`)**:
    - **Public (`public/`)**: Likely for static assets.
    - **Src (`src/`)**:
        - `App.js`: Main React component.
        - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
    - **NGINX (`nginx/`)**:
        - `nginx.conf`: Configuration for NGINX server.
    - `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the frontend Docker image.
    - `package.json`: Node.js package dependencies and scripts.
    - `.env`: Environment variables.
    - `.env.example`: Example environment variables file.

3. **CI/CD (`ci-cd/`)**:
    - `deploy.yml`: Deployment configuration for CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Deployment (`deploy/`)**:
    - `deploy.sh`: Deployment script.
    - **Systemd (`systemd/`)**:
        - `mhdb.service`: Systemd service configuration.

5. **Prometheus (`prometheus/`)**:
    - `prometheus.yml`: Configuration for Prometheus monitoring.

6. **Root Directory**:
    - `.env`: Environment variables.
    - `.dockerignore`: Files to be ignored by Docker.
    - `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration.
    - `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

### Review Notes:
- The new directory structure is well-organized, separating backend, frontend, CI/CD, deployment, and monitoring configurations.
- The use of Docker and Docker Compose files suggests containerization best practices.
- The inclusion of environment variable files (`.env` and `.env.example`) is good for managing configurations across different environments.
- The presence of a separate directory for Prometheus configuration is indicative of monitoring being a priority.

### Recommendations:
- Ensure that all configuration and script files are well-documented to help new developers understand their purpose and usage.
- Regularly update the `README.md` to reflect changes in the project structure and provide clear instructions for setup and deployment.
- Consider adding unit and integration tests if they are not already included, to maintain code quality and reliability.

Overall, the refactored directory layout is clean and follows standard conventions, making the project more maintainable and scalable.
